# EndOfTime
A small experimental website showing the countdown to the overflow of Unix time.

This is just a little fun experiment of mine. 
It is a web page that displays a countdown to the time when UNIX time overflows.

The code looks a bit strange and possibly confusing, but that doesn't matter as it's just a pastime.
